### üíº Projects
Here are some of my recent pet projects on github:

- **[Elara](https://github.com/darkmatter1971/elara)**: A PHP framework pet project for my personal use (Nothing really special). The goal is to make a simple and flaxible php framework.
- **[SBM](https://github.com/darkmatter1971/sbm)**: Another one of my pet project. A Simple Bookmark Manager to manage bookmark on firefox and probably a desk top app. The goal is to make the bookmark little bit more useful.
- **[App Installer in PHP ](https://github.com/darkmatter1971/app-installer-php)**: A PHP application installer (I know it's totally useless). I like to make as experiment. 

_**Note:**_ _I been little bit busy with my personal project so the progress of these projects are very slow_
