I started my journey of programming in late 21st sentry. I still remember when I got my first computer It had a huge CRT monitor. 

First time I got interested in computer programming when I saw a book about Visual Basic (Back then It was called Visual Basic not Visual Studio) into my older cousins bookshelf. So borrow that book and start writing code by following the instruction written in the book. It went well at first but then I hit the wall there was few problem I couldn't solve and became disinterested. then about a hear later a friend inviter to to learn web design and soon enough I fall in love with web technology.

Then spend next few year learning web design and web development and working as a freelance web developer on upwork.com (formally known oDesk) and some local freelance project.

Then in 2016 I started working at small local software company Where I used to work on various web based application but It didn't last for very long and covit hit us so now I'm mostly interested to build some open source applications here in github.

Even thought I went to the college in 2011 to learn computer science I mostly consider myself self-taught programmer.

### About My hobby 

I like to learn new technology and I'm very passionate about math and physic and I like to learn and work on artificial intelligent and quantum computer

What's my future plan 
I like to start few new project in the organization call "Dark Matter".
I like to get my computer science bachelor and continue my study (But that's has to wait for a bit)

### What I'm up to recently 

I'm trying to make some basic tutorial in my youtube channel
I'm currently working on the initial design for all the open source application I like to build
